JupyterHub
==========


**JupyterHub** is a platform connected to SLURM to start a **JupyterLab**
session as a batch job then connects it when the allocation has been granted.
It does not require any ssh tunnel or port redirection, the hub acts as a proxy
server that will redirect you to a session as soon as it is available.

It is currently available for Mila clusters and some Digital Research Alliance
of Canada (Alliance) clusters.

.. warning:: Do not forget to close the JupyterLab session! Closing the window leaves
   running the session and the SLURM job it is linked to.

   To close it, use the ``hub`` menu and then ``Control Panel > Stop my server``

.. note:: **For Mila Clusters:**

   *mila.quebec* account credentials should be used to login and start a
   **JupyterLab** session.


Access Mila Storage in JupyterLab
---------------------------------


Unfortunately, JupyterLab does not allow the navigation to parent directories of
``$HOME``. This makes some file systems like ``/network/datasets`` or
``$SLURM_TMPDIR`` unavailable through their absolute path in the interface. It
is however possible to create symbolic links to those resources. To do so, you
can use the ``ln -s`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

   ln -s /network/datasets $HOME

Note that ``$SLURM_TMPDIR`` is a directory that is dynamically created for each
job so you would need to recreate the symbolic link every time you start a
JupyterHub session:

.. code-block:: bash

   ln -sf $SLURM_TMPDIR $HOME
